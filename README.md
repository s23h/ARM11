# ARM11
Emulator created for the ARM11 Processor, written in C, emulating a subset of the instruction set. 
Assembler designed to produce machine executable code for a subset of the instructions in the ARM11 instruction set.
Our extension is a program written in assembly, using the limited subset of instructions that our emulator supports. It is a random number generator, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and shows the number on a 7-segment arrangement of LEDs connected to GPIO pins.   

/src contains all the source code for the emulator and assembler, include any utility functions. 

/doc contains the documentation and final report for the project

/programs contains the extension programs


Created for a C Group Project at Imperial College London in collaboration with Prem Chowdhry, Suphanant Sangwowanich and Zimu Zeng.
